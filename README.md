# Console petpet

A nice little pet that reminds you to hydrate with some configured options on startup.

It's not really useful at all, but it's just there because I wanted to make something other than a discord bot for once.

## How to use

Open your local terminal and run `petpet-setup`, once you've gone through that process you can then use `petpet-start`
to start your lil' pet.
